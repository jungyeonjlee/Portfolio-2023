          <p class="para">Aritzia is a Vancouver based clothing line that runs several retail stores across the Lower Mainland. 
            We aim to allow exploratory users to discover new items of clothing, while also catering to returning customers. 
            This is achieved by editorial-style webpages, grid-focused webpages and informing shoppers 
            the details of product materials and it's purpose in your wardrobe.

        <h2 class="text-5xl">Due to the online barrier found in ecommerce, we found it difficult to replicate the convenience
           and feeling of the in-person experience of shopping.</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="para">There was a disconnect between the customer and the online shopping experience which led to customers

      <p class="para">What I aim to do with this iteration is to allow exploratory users to discover new items of
        clothing and feel
        confident about their choices.
        However, there is also the choice for mission based customers that know what they are looking for to do so
        efficiently.</p>

    <p class="para">Now you might be asking, what about the research? <br>
      Let's approach the two main themes that were explored:</p>

    <section class="flex gap-y-6 flex-col my-20 mx-64">

      <div>
        <p class="para" class="font-light">INSIGHTS</p>
        <h2 class="text-5xl">Personalizing content builds loyalty and trust in the brand.</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="para">Revealing content through an editorial-style experience for those shoppers looking to browse online.</p>
        <p class="para">Limiting the amount of pages shoppers have to look through by allowing them to pick and choose
           products that appeal to them through a tag-based system.</p>


      <h2 class="text-5xl">An online website that replicates the in-person experience instills confidence in the user's shopping decisions.</h2>
      <p class="para">Informing shoppers the details of how each product is made and what purpose it's supposed to have in your wardrobe. 
        This must be achieved without having the in-person aspect of the feel and look of the product.</p>

    </section>

    <section class="flex gap-y-6 flex-col my-20 mx-64">

      <div>
        <p class="para" class="font-light">THE ARITZIA BRAND</p>
        <h2 class="text-5xl">In-house designs.</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="para">Aritzia is unique in the sense that it does not carry any Aritzia brand clothing, instead they use in-house designers
         that make up the majority of the brands sold in Aritzia. For example, their Babaton brand works towards minimalism that excels for work wear
          and classier nights out. <br><br> And what better way to personalize content when the brand already values that?</p>

    </section>

    <section class="flex gap-y-6 flex-col my-20 mx-64">

      <div>
        <p class="para" class="font-light">CLOSING THOUGHTS</p>
        <h2 class="text-5xl">What would I do next time?</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="para">
        This was my first true user experience design project and in traditional UX fashion, here are some things I would do differently now: <br><br>
        
        Conduct user research and ethnography research on our themes such as what exactly instills confidence
         in a person inside and outside of a shopping context. How, where, why do people consume content? 
         This would all drastically change the framing of the problem, resulting in a very different project.<br><br>

         Have more iterations! We played it safe and used industry precedents, but we could have explored crazier things
        like 360 degrees AI generated models of the customers to keep our minds open. <br><br>

        Usability Testing to see if the methods in which people consume content, ex. editorial magazines,
          can or should be translated into web.</p> <br><br>

        <p class="para">There's lots more I'd like to discuss, but for now, thank you for reading my first ever case study and I hope to speak to you soon!</p> <br><br>
